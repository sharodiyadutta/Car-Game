🚗 Car Rush – Unity Prototype

Car Rush is a fast-paced 3D driving prototype built in Unity. The player controls a car that races down a dynamic road, collecting coins while avoiding obstacles. Designed as an early gameplay test, this project demonstrates fundamental mechanics of movement, collision detection, particle effects, and scene transitions.

🎮 Gameplay Overview

Objective:
Collect all the coins on the track to finish the level.

Controls:

⬅️ / ➡️ — Move the car left or right

⬆️ — Accelerate

⬇️ — Slow down

Gameplay Flow:

Start at the Landing Page and hit the Play button.

Drive, collect coins, and avoid obstacles.

When all coins are collected → a Game Over screen appears.

✨ Features

Smooth Player Controls: Responsive car movement system.

Collectibles System: Coins trigger particle effects and scoring.

Particle Effects: Sparkle animations appear only when a coin is collected.

Audio Design: Background music and collection sound effects for immersive play.

UI System: Landing (Start) screen and Game Over screen integrated.

Modular Scene Design: Easy to expand for multiple levels or endless mode.
